 pick functionality you know you can accomplish in the given time, i will take care in the admin side

create new branch when you clone this repository and push the changes in the branch you created
(I will create a model for the database schema so you don't need to create table manually in your local server database)

 here are the possible functionalities:
 *simple log in and register(maybe only front-end validation)
 * USER-SIDE:
 * can log in and register
 * browse products
 * search
 * add to cart
 * remove items to cart
 * can place order

include the styles, we will use tailwindcss it's just like bootstrap you will use class 
just add this link to your <head> of file <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/output.css" >

you can browse this cheatsheet for the classes https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet

When you run the project type this in the terminal:
npm start 



(to start the node project)

add another terminal tab and type this:
npm run dev 

(to start the tailwindcss auto-refresh when you have changes)
